# gbz80-pseudoOps
Set of rgbasm macros and constants to facilitate readability for modern programmers.

I've only just started using ASM, but like most programmers born in the 90s I've gotten used to 
a) Doing things in one step instead of two and 
b) camelCase.  
So this is my attempt to simplify the writing and most relevantly the reading of asm code without comprimising the control over optimisation required to run gameboy software as well as it needs to run.

No idea if any of this code actually works.
